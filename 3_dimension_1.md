This exploration is all about the single dataflow exploration of a given workload on an event driven archecture using the tools Zigzag(Single core exploration) and Stream (Multi core exploration)

1. How to get all the possible mappings combination to do the test?

2. Taking details from the background study on how the Frame based execution and the Event based execution occurs and also the combination of the possible mapping to run the effect on latency and the energy and the EDP is as follows:

[From the background study, 1. Frame based execution, 2. Event based execution]


2.1. Zigzag lenet 5 model implementation on the following architecture and possible mapping

Results of Latency, energy and EDP (Single bar graph)

2.2. Stream lenet 5 model implementation on the following architecture and possible mapping

Results of latency, energy and EDP (Single bar graph)

2.3. Upon validation of the Zigzag and Stream for the lenet 5 model the follwing results are supposed to be achieved

Results of latency, energy and EDP (double bar graph) - With comparision of the both and the change in the results

2.4. Implication of this difference on the current solution and the exploration

2.5 Proposed solution implementation.
