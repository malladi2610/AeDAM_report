1. Event driven exploration papers, why didn't any one try to explore the event driven accelerators

2. Zigzag, Timeloop cost models remain same for event driven accelerators too if the way on how the modeling is done changes

3. What are the different design space exploration variables and which one of them would be beneficial to explore for event driven accelerators 

4. The idea should structure are as folows:

4.1. Single dataflow exploration using stream and Zigzag as it is with some tweaks
4.2. Dimension 2 exploration
4.3. Dimension 3 exploration
4.4. Add sparsity in the workload to do the exploration

This is more a result oriented thesis than development, it is mainly to prove haivng what architecture configuration is better for a given workload


- What is an exploration tool?
- What are different types of accelerators based on their executions types?
- How the exploration is different for each type of accelerators
- What are the important exploration parameters for each accelerators?
- Missing study of exploration parameters for event driven accelerators
    - Benefits of doing this study
- What does AeDAM toolflow.
    - From the high level to the exploration level
- Expected results of this thesis
