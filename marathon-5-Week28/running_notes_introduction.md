#### Question 1:

Introduction section:

This section includes 
1. Motivation
2. Problem statement
3. Research gap (High level missinng work description without taking the tools names)
4. Contributions done to address it on a high level

And finally include the high level block diagram.

Can you help me write these things for the introduction section of my report. I will provide you with my slides of Problem statment, Research Gap and COntributions but they need to be modifed and used here as in introduction of the report should discuss entire project in a high level and level gap for the results as I am yet to implement the results and get proper comparision results.

Make sure this introduction meets the standards of academic writing a journal papers. Use all the previous discussions's information that we have learnt so far about my project to write the introduction.
