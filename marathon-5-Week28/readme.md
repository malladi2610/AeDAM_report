# Marathon goals - 30rd (12:30 PM) - 31th (12:30 PM)

1. [Yes] Build Zigzag validation and also study NAAS to find the solution for the extra partial sum count and see how stream can take advantage of it
2. [No] Build a script that gives all the possible maps to run without missing out on any combination (As this process needs to be done manually)
3. [Yes] Get a basic running of the stream with our architecture and simple model/ Lenet would be great
4. [No] Make AeDAM repo such that Zigzag is the base and the stream uses the same Zigzag base and push the latest changes to the repo
5. Send overleaf to the Kanishkan and Bishnoi
    5.1. An abstract which is the combination of the Introduction and Basics of Background
    5.2. Complete (1st draft) the Introduction and Background Study of the report and the dimension 1 exploration (draft) just waiting for the result in coming two weeks
    5.3. The results from the Dimension-1 exploration with graphs and tables
    5.4. (For kanishkan) Push the code in the Zigzag stream and AeDAM for his validation


1. The thought process to build an algorithms is as follow

1.1. [ ] Prove that there is a limiation with the zigzag over calculation not only by validation but in theory
1.2  [ ] Build a basic algorithm to solve the problem and write it in a presentable manner
1.3  [ ] Validate the algorithm by seperately testing it outside zigzag for Single layer, Lenet - 5 model, Other models given by kanishkan on TPU
1.4  [ ] Propose a way to integrate it.

# Marathon closing 
In this marathon I present the limitation of the zigzag tool not being able to give the correct extimation of the event driven nature, but in our specific case as the workload scales that particular issue of the over estimation solves on it's own means, it becomes negligible in terms of error which is acceptable in our situation
