- [Yes] Extract all the best possible possible event driven mapping from zigzag to a json (With out the search implementation)
- [Yes] Test these possible mappings and see if there is any difference in the energy or any other parameter - There is no change
- [ ] Increase the workload size and make sure the error b/w the Frame based and event based execution is less than 10% for different sizes and generate the graphs
- [ ] Try complete lenet-5 model for the frame based and event based for this above decided big workload and show the comparision graph
- [ ] Vaslidate the results in two ways the values generated (Over estimated values) and the logical calcualtion with boundary alignment for the best case
- [ ] Build the final pipeline based on the above test done
- [ ] Test the final single core pipeline with one example in the google coral boards with an application associated with it
- [ ] Document the results in the overleaf and also in the ppt
- [ ] Push these changes to the Actual zigzag pipeline (intead of this monkey patch ) and add those to the AeDAM repo and push the changes
